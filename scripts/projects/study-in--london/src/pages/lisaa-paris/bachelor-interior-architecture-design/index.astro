  "Program_description": "The Interior Architecture & Design program at LISAA Paris is a five-year integrated course that awards a Bachelor’s degree after the third year, followed by two years at the Master's level (Years 4 and 5) in line with the French higher education model.\n\nStudents begin with a foundational year, progressing through advanced design training and professional immersion. The curriculum develops both creative and managerial skills, enabling graduates to:\n\nAnalyze a client brief and develop a structured interior design proposal.\n\nIncorporate trends and innovation to create meaningful spatial solutions.\n\nOversee project execution and coordinate suppliers and service providers.\n\nSpecializations in Years 4 and 5 include global design, hospitality, sustainable design, scenography, and UX & interactive environments. The course is available in French and English, with mandatory internships in Years 3 and 4. The final year may be completed as a sandwich course (alternance), combining paid employment with study.\n\nGraduates earn a Level 7 RNCP certification, recognized across Europe, and are prepared for careers in interior architecture, spatial design, scenography, and user-centered experiential environments.\n\nAlso offered at LISAA campuses in Rennes, Nantes, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Montpellier.",
