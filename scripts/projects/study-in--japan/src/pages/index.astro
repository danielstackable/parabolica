            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The BA (Hons) Business & Entrepreneurship at Regent’s University London prepares students to launch ventures or lead innovation within established organisations. Delivered in the heart of London, the program develops core competencies in finance, operations, law, and organisational behaviour, while cultivating strategic thinking, creativity, and entrepreneurial leadership.

Students learn to generate business ideas, validate markets, build and pitch business plans, and manage uncertainty. The curriculum integrates simulations, bootcamps, and live industry briefs. Opportunities include pitching to real investors during Regent’s Den, and attending talks from leaders at Meta, Harrods, Burberry, and McLaren Automotive.

Emphasis is placed on experiential learning, iterative testing, and the use of emerging technologies in business growth. Graduates are equipped to found startups, scale ventures, or drive intrapreneurial initiatives in global firms.
