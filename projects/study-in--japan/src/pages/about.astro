  <h1>About InterFrontera</h1>
  <p><strong>InterFrontera Ltd.</strong> is a UK-registered education innovation company helping students explore and access international programs around the world.</p>

  <p>We created <em>study-in--japan.com</em> to make it easier for students to discover English-taught undergraduate degrees at Japanese universities. Japan’s higher education system is exceptional—but hard to navigate across hundreds of disconnected university websites, many of which lack English support.</p>

  <p>We are <strong>not affiliated</strong> with JASSO, MEXT, or any Japanese government body. Instead, we curate and structure public information about universities and programs to help improve global access. We always link back to official university or government sources.</p>

  <p>InterFrontera also works with universities, investors, and student platforms to co-design new academic programs and global student pathways.</p>
